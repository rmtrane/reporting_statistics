## Introduction/Purpose

This set of slides aim at providing some guidelines for reporting statistical analyses and methods. 

Loosely based on the SAMPL Guidelines for Biomedical Journals by Thomas Lang and Douglas Altman [@LANG20155].

## THE General Principle 

From @LANG20155:

**Describe statistical methods with enough detail to enable a knowledgeable reader with access to the original data to verfy the reported results.**

**Provide enough detail that the results can be incorporated into other analyses.**

Basically, make sure your analysis is reproducible to someone with the right statistical knowledge, but no prior knowledge about your work.
